### Simple command-line tool that accepts a single argument ```ejectall``` and quickly and safely ejects all connected removable-media.

### To install:

```shell
    npm install ejectall -g
```
### Then:

``` shell
ejectall
```

#### With version 1.1.0 we have:

- ejects even faster than before
- works on both linux and mac
- does not require reference to another file for bash command execution

__This is a simple node module that quickly ejects all devices mounted to a target
computer.__

_Note: :notes:_

  Unfortunately, this will only work on mac and linux machines only!

  __Listen!__

  how to make this work on windows, that would be awesome.
